This repository includes my solutions for the involved problems in the Google Hash Code 2020 competition. More detailed information can be found from the link above.

The description of the problem in the practice round can be found in the [practice_problem](https://github.com/bofeng2018/Google-Hash-Code-2020/edit/master/practice_problem.pdf) pdf file. Corresponding test datasets are in the format of IN files.
