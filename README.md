# Google-Hash-Code-2020
This repository includes my solutions for the involved problems in the [Google Hash Code 2020](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode) competition. The description of the problem in the practice round can be found in [practice_problem](https://github.com/bofeng2018/Google-Hash-Code-2020/blob/master/practice_problem.pdf). Corresponding test datasets are in the format of IN files. 5 test datasets are provided, i.e. [a_example](https://github.com/bofeng2018/Google-Hash-Code-2020/blob/master/a_example.in), [b_small](https://github.com/bofeng2018/Google-Hash-Code-2020/blob/master/b_small.in), [c_medium](https://github.com/bofeng2018/Google-Hash-Code-2020/blob/master/c_medium.in), [d_quite_big](https://github.com/bofeng2018/Google-Hash-Code-2020/blob/master/d_quite_big.in), [e_also_big](https://github.com/bofeng2018/Google-Hash-Code-2020/blob/master/e_also_big.in).
